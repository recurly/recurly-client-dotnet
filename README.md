Specify your [API Key, site subdomain](https://app.recurly.com/go/developer/api_access), and (optionally) page size
setting in your `app.config` or `web.config` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

  <configSections>
    <section name="recurly" type="Recurly.Configuration.Section,Recurly"/>

</configuration>
```

## Client Documentation

Full C# API documentation is on our [developer docs site](https://dev.recurly.com/docs/getting-started)
and in [examples.md](./examples.md).

### Example usage
To create an account with `account code` and `name`:

```c#
var account = new Account("123")
{
	FirstName = "John",
	LastName = "Smith"
}
account.Create();
```

Get the account with `account code` 123:

```c#
var account = Accounts.Get("123");
```

List all available `Accounts` and print their `account codes`:

```c#
var accounts = Accounts.List();
foreach (var account in accounts)
	Console.WriteLine(account.AccountCode);
```

Get an account's billing information:

```c#
var account = Accounts.Get("123");
var info = account.BillingInfo;
```

Create a coupon with code **WINTER**, name, and with a 10% discount:

```c#
var coupon = new Coupon("WINTER", "Winter discount", 10);
coupon.Create();
```

Redeem that coupon on an account that uses US dollars, getting a `CouponRedemption` object:

```c#
var redemption = account.RedeemCoupon("WINTER", "USD");
```

Each section of the API (Accounts, Invoices, Transactions, etc.) has static references for getting or listing their
types and concrete implementations for manipulating concrete objects.

### async/await
Partial support for async overloads is supported. By convention async enabled method names have the "Async" suffix: `GetSubscriptionAsync(string uuid)`.

Note: All async methods deal with IO bound work such as responses to HTTP requests therefore none of the implementations wrap synchronous methods in a background thread via `Task.Run` or other. This will improve responsiveness of desktop applications and scalability of web servers.
